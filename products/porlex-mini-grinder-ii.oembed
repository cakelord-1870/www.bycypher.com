{"product_id":"porlex-mini-grinder-ii","title":"Porlex Mini Grinder II","description":"\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its newly designed burr set, the \u003cstrong\u003ePorlex II\u003c\/strong\u003e canÂ grind beans easier, faster, and more evenly. This results in less fines, less boulders, and more even grounds. Do you know what they say about even grounds? More delicious coffee in your mouth! Compared to the Porlex I, this grinder can produce roughly 1.3 times more coffee with the same number of rotations. Wow! There is no need to worry about the top of the grinder rolling away like a boulder in Indiana Jones - Porlex has redesigned the adjustment nut so that it stands up proud and tall on its own! With the new burr, the per-click adjustment changes an average of 37 microns - meaning you can further dial in your Hario V60 recipe. Made in Japan with higher quality materials than its predecessor, the Porlex II punches above its weight - scaring its rivals back to their grinder travel pouch caves.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Cypher Roastery","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":39372657950795,"sku":"","price":368.0,"currency_code":"AED","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1857\/4371\/products\/porlex_be973a03-df9f-4c59-8cec-9e99a430b10c.png?v=1621930087","url":"https:\/\/www.bycypher.com\/products\/porlex-mini-grinder-ii","provider":"Cypher Roastery","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
